## Overview

HopeHub is a mobile-first platform designed to empower digitally underserved and homeless communities by providing them simple, tangible ways to earn, track, and redeem HopePoints. The platform turns everyday positive actions — like completing microjobs, reporting safety incidents, or attending trainings — into HopePoints that can be redeemed for essential services such as food coupons, transportation tickets, and hygiene kits.

HopeHub is built with accessibility at its core: offering a website, a simple SMS-based interaction model for users without smartphones, and an admin dashboard for monitoring engagement and platform performance.
